# Linux-Scripts

A repository for some of the simple scripts made by me for setting up fresh Linux Desktop / Server Installations.

## Description

These are some simple scripts I use after a fresh installation of Linux Desktop / Server to finish the setup.
These scripts installs some basic apps from different sources and installs different dependencies & Package-Managers for which other apps depend on.

[Note: As of now the scripts are for Ubuntu Desktop / Server only. Working on scripts for ARCH, FEDORA & RHEL.]

### Features

**Note: This section will be updated as new scripts are added.**

1. Installs basic apps like HTOP, Neofetch, VIM etc.
2. Installs dependencies like "apt-transport-https", "ca-certificates", "nodejs" etc.
3. Installs Package-Managers like NPM, PIP, SNAP etc.
4. Installs Docker for current user without user interacton.

## Disclaimer

*Do not run these scripts if you don't understand what they do. These can make unwanted changes to your system. Take a look inside the scripts before running them.*
